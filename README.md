## Product Description

Forex GOLD Investor MT5 is a trading robot designed to trade gold (XAUUSD) on the MetaTrader 5 platform. It utilizes various trading strategies, intelligent money management, and drawdown protection to optimize trading performance.

The main features of Forex GOLD Investor MT5 include:

1. Scalping Trading Strategy: The robot performs scalping by opening buy or sell trades based on the current price of gold. If the price exceeds the defined threshold, a buy trade is opened, and if the price falls below the negative threshold, a sell trade is opened.

2. Time-Based Dependency Trading: The robot also incorporates time-based dependency trading, with trades being opened only during specified hours (8 AM to 4 PM). This feature aims to take advantage of specific market conditions during certain times of the day.

3. Intelligent Money Management: Forex GOLD Investor MT5 adjusts the trade volume based on the account balance. It automatically sets a lower trade volume for smaller account balances and increases the trade volume for larger account balances.

4. Precise Entry and Exit Trading: The robot determines precise entry and exit points based on market conditions. It opens buy or sell trades based on the current price and sets stop loss and take profit levels to manage risk and maximize potential profits.

5. Drawdown Protection: To protect against excessive drawdown, Forex GOLD Investor MT5 monitors the account equity and balance. If the drawdown exceeds a specific threshold (10%), all trades are closed to prevent further losses.
